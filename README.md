## Parsing RDF data in BaseX

This is a Java/XQuery/XSLT package for parsing the RDF serializations in BaseX (currently TriG, Turtle, N-Triples). The parser was generated by [GÃ¼nther Rademacher's REx Parser Generator](http://www.bottlecaps.de/rex/) from the EBNF for the [TriG serialization](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/).

Current status: beta 0.1
